                                The year didn't kick the door down—it kind of... knocked politely. At work, week one was unusually calm. I got to tidy up product loose ends, actually think, and map out the quarter without everything being on fire. Personally, we kept it simple. Quiet mornings, slower evenings, and just enough time to look back at last year without immediately sprinting into the new one.

                                This also lined up with a "bootstrapped YC-energy" batch that some alumni put together to recreate the beginning-of-year momentum. I joined. It's been... fine. Engagement is low, and I'm still deciding if the admin overhead is worth the squeeze.

                                <strong style="color: #ff71ce;">Floof launched.</strong> And that alone is a win. I hit a wall when I tried to expand the infrastructure to support multiple pets (and different types of pets). It felt like one wrong move would snap the whole thing in half. But I learned how to ship: App Store release, analytics, the whole loop.

                                <strong style="color: #ff71ce;">Mistasho</strong> didn't make it out of the driveway. This was my first batch idea, and it got zero pull. I made a Google Form and the only people who responded were my dad and my spouse. Brutal. Also: technically, it's gnarly—linking in/out of Instagram/Facebook/LinkedIn is way harder than it looks. I never started building it. Conceptually it was "ReciMe, but for everything"—crafts, workouts, random internet gems.

                                <strong style="color: #ff71ce;">LaunchSignal</strong> got the full sprint treatment. This one still feels right. The problem is: it's big. There are a hundred entry points and I don't know which door matters most. That said, I did a full-cycle launch in under 24 hours: landing page, TikTok ads, launch. I even used Gemini to generate videos, which was surprisingly fun. Traction improved slightly—still not "TAKE MY MONEY" energy, but enough to keep the ember lit.

                                <strong>Other ideas that tried to steal the spotlight:</strong> I found an app called SORCE—job applications as a swipe experience. My brain immediately tried to copy-paste that mechanic into: "what should we eat tonight?" and, honestly, the best one: apartment hunting. Didn't build any of these. But they're sitting in the idea parking lot, engines idling.

                                Week two: chaos returned. We were pushing toward the Preventix launch—our first real study on Curebase Zero (the rebuilt platform). We needed a release by Feb 2. Spoiler: we didn't make it. We thought we'd gotten ahead of integration hell, but integration hell is one of those places you don't arrive at—you just look up and realize you've been living there.

                                Everything else got eclipsed by the <strong style="color: #05ffa1;">road trip of a lifetime</strong>: Owen Sound to Murrieta, California. We planned for weeks and left on Jan 19. The reason it happened is simple: my spouse refused to put Charlie under a plane. Respect. My parents came too, which turned it from "long drive" into "core memory." There's a specific kind of gratitude that only shows up when you're doing something ridiculous and wonderful with people you love—and this trip had a lot of that.

                                I stayed pretty consistent with workouts through all of this. I was aiming for an average of 1600 calories/day, and I was holding the line... until California. Out here the routine softened a bit. But I'm not spiraling about it. I wake up, do my best, and occasionally let joy win—like when a Bundt cake appears and I simply accept my fate.

                                I saw a reel from a fairly famous musician talking about what he'd do differently if he started over. His advice was weirdly practical: Get a skill other people need (photography, production, design), then offer it cheaply—or free—until you've built a real network. That hit. So I offered landing page building to builders around Owen Sound, and that's how <strong style="color: #ff71ce;">knot-audio connection</strong> happened. I revamped their website pre-launch (still in progress), and the process taught me a lot about CMS work—especially TinaCMS. That's a new tool in the belt, and I'd happily do more builds like this.

                                California has been unreal: sun every day, warm air, bright mornings that don't feel like a negotiation. Being here with my parents, Callum, Lenny, and Charlie has been the best kind of reset. We've hiked a ton and did some genuinely special day trips: Catalina Island, Coronado / San Diego, and Oceanside for whale watching when my brother John visited. I don't have enough words for how thankful I feel. So I'll just say it plainly: I'm lucky, and I know it.

                                Callum and I have been going to a gym called METROFLEX, and it's hard to explain unless you've been inside. Here's my best attempt:

                                <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">men with forearms the size of both my legs combined</li>
                                <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">women squatting numbers that shouldn't be legal</li>
                                <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">American flags at a rate of one per square foot (including two massive ones hanging off the back of the owner's lifted F150)</li>

                                Why did I drag Callum here? Two reasons: it was a good deal, and they have as much equipment outside as they do inside. Lifting in the fresh air is genuinely awesome. Very California. Cal has... learned to love it.

                                ✂️ The Barber Shop Story
                            </h2>
                            
                            <p style="margin: 0 0 20px 0; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);">
                                Murrieta barber shop: great haircut, absurd conversation. A young Christian guy cut my hair and started by telling me how badly he wanted to travel outside the U.S. That escalated into: "I want to see women around the world." I tried to steer it into "meeting people, culture, the whole thing," and he swerved straight into: "I'm mostly into Latinas." Which is... funny, considering he's an hour from Mexico and San Diego has a huge Latina population. But sure. Travel.

                                Then it got better: he said he was planning a trip to Bali later that year and: didn't have a passport (and didn't have plans to get one), and didn't know passports expire. Incredible.
                            </p>

                                Again: 10/10 haircut. He told me to find a barber back home who's good with shears. Meanwhile, in Owen Sound, I'm lucky to find a barber at all.

                                ⛪ Mega Church Culture
                            </h2>

                                Here's a wild detail: on either side of METROFLEX are two mega churches. I've never seen anything like it. Church culture is embedded into American life in a way I've never experienced in Canada. The buildings are literally grocery-store sized—in strip malls—with grocery-store parking lots. One Sunday when Cal and I went to the gym, every spot was taken. Full. They were shuttling people around in golf carts. It's fascinating... and a little unsettling. A lot of power concentrated in one vibe.

                                I've been working 5:30am to 2:00pm out here, and it's elite. At 2pm, the day is still wide open. We'll often go out for a warm hike, and the extra sunlight makes everything feel easier. Also, I've been building out more of <a href="https://noahdebrincat.com" style="color: #05ffa1; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid #05ffa1;">noahdebrincat.com</a>—it's getting more robust by the week.

                                Chasing rejection is me treating "no" like proof I showed up, not proof I wasn't good enough. Every ask is a lottery ticket—most don't hit, but you can't win the ones you never buy. So I'm collecting nos on purpose this year, because a life with fewer maybes is worse than a life with a few bruises.
